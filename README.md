# High-cloud-Airlines-Dashboard

Problem statement:
Airline operations generate large volumes of data, making it difficult to extract clear insights without effective data tools. This project addresses that challenge by transforming raw flight data into structured formats using SQL and creating dynamic dashboards in Power BI. The result is a powerful, visual exploration of key metrics like load factors, flight frequency, and route efficiency to support better decision-making.


Objective:
- To build insightful, interactive dashboards using Power BI that analyze and visualize airline flight data. 
- The goal is to extract meaningful patterns related to carrier performance, regional flight trends, and overall air traffic, showcasing strong skills in data querying, transformation, and visual storytelling.


Tools used for Project:
1. Excel: Consolidate data from various files using VLOOKUP

2. Power Query: It was used to clean, transform and append the data.

3. MySQL: Queries were framed for detailed analysis.

4. Power BI: All the KPI's were plotted on graphs and interactive dashboard was built for holistic analysis.

5.DAX: Use of Calculate and Time intelligence functions to dive deeper into data through mathematical formulas.

Key Insights Gained:
1. The Airline Operated Across 104 Countries, 208 Airlines, 67 States, And 1,296 Cities, With 1,440 Destination Airports And 1,406 Origin Airports, Transporting Over 187 Million Passengers And Covering A Total Distance Of 82 Million Miles.
2. Short-haul Flights (Less Than 500 Miles) Dominated The Traffic, With Over 86,000+ Flights, Indicating Strong Regional Connectivity And Operational Concentration In Short-distance Routes.
3. The Most Frequent Flight Routes Included:
Chicago, IL → Detroit, MI
Washington, DC → New York, NY
Charlotte, NC → Atlanta, GA These Routes Consistently Had High Flight Frequencies, Suggesting Key Business Corridors Or High-traffic Connections
4. Southwest Airlines And Delta Air Lines Emerged As Top-performing Carriers, Both In Terms Of Passenger Volume And Load Factor Efficiency, Indicating High Customer Preference And Operational Reliability.
5. Passenger Load Factor Showed Notable Patterns:
- Weekends Had A Significantly Higher Load Factor (71.17%) Compared To Weekdays (28.83%), Pointing To A Shift In Demand Toward Leisure Or Weekend Travel.
- Among The Quarters, Q3 (July–September) Consistently Recorded The Highest Load Factor (26.31%), Aligning With Typical Holiday/Travel Seasons.
6. The Load Factor By Carrier Analysis Revealed:
Delta Airlines Had The Highest Load Factor At 17.01%
Followed By Southwest Airlines (16.49%)
Other Notable Carriers Included US Airways, Continental Airlines, JetBlue, And AirTran.
7. Visualization Tools Like Interactive Slicers And Filters By Year And Month Enabled Dynamic Exploration Of Flight Trends Across 2008 To 2013, Offering Deeper Insight Into Seasonal Or Yearly Shifts In Travel Patterns.

Conclusion:
Through This Project, We have highlighted that Airlines need to focus on Short domestic flights in the long run, especially in continents like South Asia where the Population is growing at a faster pace. They should increase flight frequencies between Industrial corridors , IT hubs like Silicon valley and Political capitals.
